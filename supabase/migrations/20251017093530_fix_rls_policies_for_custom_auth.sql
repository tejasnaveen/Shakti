/*
  # Fix RLS Policies for Custom Authentication System
  
  ## Overview
  This migration updates RLS policies to work with our custom authentication system.
  Since we're not using Supabase Auth but instead have a custom super_admins table,
  we need to allow anon access to the tables (security is handled by application layer).
  
  ## Changes
  1. Drop all existing restrictive RLS policies
  2. Create new policies that allow anon role access
  3. Maintain RLS enabled for audit trail purposes
  
  ## Security Note
  - Application layer authentication through super_admins table
  - Frontend validates credentials before allowing operations
  - Anon key is used but operations are still logged
  - Consider implementing JWT-based auth in future for better security
